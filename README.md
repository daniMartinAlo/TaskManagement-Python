# TaskManagement-Python
It is a small task manager that I made as a final test in the IBM Python FullStack course. In the Readme you can find the statement of the test.

## Exercise Statement

Write a Python program using Object-Oriented Programming to manage a to-do list. The program should allow the user to perform the following operations:
- **Add a new task:** The program should allow the user to add a new task to the to-do list.
- **Mark a task as completed:** The program should allow the user to mark a task as completed, given its position in the list.
- **Show all tasks:** The program should print all pending tasks, numbered and showing their status (completed or pending).
- **Delete a task:** The program should allow the user to delete a task from the list, given its position.

The program should include the following features:
- **Exception handling:** The program should handle exceptions in case the user enters an invalid option or a position that does not exist in the list.
- **Explanatory comments:** The code should be commented to explain its functionality in each relevant part.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
